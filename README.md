Project Description:
The project involves in-depth analysis of an Amazon electronics sales dataset to reveal consumer habits, product performance and sales trends. The project's aim is to use Python programming as well as other data science concepts to understand market dynamics better, thereby facilitating strategic business decision-making. 

Dataset:
This dataset was used in a data science contest by Capgemini. The main concept was to build a product recommendation system. The dataset gives us electronics sales data at Amazon. It contains user ratings for various electronics items sold, along with category of each item and time of sell. https://www.techgig.com/files/contest_upload_files/electronics.csv The dataset is a great start for building a product recommendation system based on user ratings, brands, and timestamps.


Technologies Used: 
• Python (for analyzing data and visualizing findings) 
• Pandas (for data manipulation) 
• NumPy (for numerical computation)
• Matplotlib/Seaborn(for data visualization).
